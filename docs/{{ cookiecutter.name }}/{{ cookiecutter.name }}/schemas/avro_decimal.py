Input/Output utilities, including:

 * i/o-specific constants
 * i/o-specific exceptions
 * schema validation
 * leaf value encoding and decoding
 * datum reader/writer stuff (?)

Also includes a generic representation for data, which
uses the following mapping:

  * Schema records are implemented as dict.
  * Schema arrays are implemented as list.
  * Schema maps are implemented as dict.
  * Schema strings are implemented as str.
  * Schema bytes are implemented as bytes.
  * Schema ints are implemented as int.
  * Schema longs are implemented as int.
  * Schema floats are implemented as float.
  * Schema doubles are implemented as float.
  * Schema booleans are implemented as bool.

Validation:

The validation of schema is performed using breadth-first graph
traversal. This allows validation exceptions to pinpoint the exact node
within a complex schema that is problematic, simplifying debugging
considerably. Because it is a traversal, it will also be less
resource-intensive, particularly when validating schema with deep
structures.

Components
==========

Nodes
-----
Avro schemas contain many different schema types. Data about the schema
types is used to validate the data in the corresponding part of a Python
body (the object to be serialized). A node combines a given schema type
with the corresponding Python data, as well as an optional "name" to
identify the specific node. Names are generally the name of a schema
(for named schema) or the name of a field (for child nodes of schema
with named children like maps and records), or None, for schema who's
children are not named (like Arrays).

Iterators
---------
Iterators are generator functions that take a node and return a
generator which will yield a node for each child datum in the data for
the current node. If a node is of a type which has no children, then the
default iterator will immediately exit.

Validators
----------
Validators are used to determine if the datum for a given node is valid
according to the given schema type. Validator functions take a node as
an argument and return a node if the node datum passes validation. If it
does not, the validator must return None.

In most cases, the node returned is identical to the node provided (is
in fact the same object). However, in the case of Union schema, the
returned "valid" node will hold the schema that is represented by the
datum contained. This allows iteration over the child nodes
in that datum, if there are any.
